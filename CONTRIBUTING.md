## Opening issues if you are not a developer

- Create a github account if you don't have one!
- Take a moment to look for past issues that might be identical to yours, using the search bar. There might be discussion or solution about the problem you faced.
- Please open a separate issue for each problem. That makes solving them and keeping track of things easier.
- Include a clear description of the problem.
- Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- Include screenshots if applicable.
- Provide a short description of your computer configuration and what is relevant (OS+version, version of CaPTk you are using, RAM etc)
- If the data you used to reach the problematic state can be shared, please do share them! It will help a lot. Please only share anonymized data, never share data containing [Protected Health Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_health_information).

## Handling issues if you are a developer

- Make sure to assist the person opening the issue, and guide him through giving a clear description / steps to reproduce.
- Label the issue based on severity. In ascending order, we use 4 levels: Trivial, Minor, Major, Critical.
- Prioritize solving critical issues.
- If you know the person that usually handles the relevant part of the code, assign them to the issue.
- If the issue is a feature request, label it with "Enhancement".
- If an issue is a duplicate, label it as "Duplicate" and close it.

## Code contributions

- Please see [[the wiki]](https://github.com/CBICA/CaPTk2.0/wiki/Developer-Guide) for instructions on how to build.
- Please refrain from writing lines using more than ~90 characters.
- Comment/comment/comment your code
- Document your functions & classes using [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html)
- Write documentation for your plugins, in the file ```PLUGINDIR/documentation/UserManual/${YourPluginName}Plugin.dox``` 
- Each function should do one thing (generally speaking)
- Please do calculations that last > 1 second in background threads, to not hang the GUI.
- Namespace your modules (and not plugins) classes/functions with the ```captk``` namespace.
- One file per class. 
- If you develop the class ```captk::ExampleAlgorithm```, it should be defined in a file called CaPTkExampleAlgorithm.h
- Separate implementations from definitions.
- Don't include new dependencies unless they are absolutely needed.

## Pull requests

- Strive to create small and easy-to-review PRs. 
- One issue per PR (unless there is a connection between 2+ issues)
- Don't fix random things you see at random places that are outside the scope of your PR. Alternatively, make a note of them and open a separate PR later with fixes for those, or open an issue about them.
- At least one approval is required before merging your changes.
- Write the issue you are solving at the description (i.e. first comment) of your PR. That will also close the issue automatically when your PR gets merged.
